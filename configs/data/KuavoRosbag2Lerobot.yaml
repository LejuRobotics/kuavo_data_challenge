# kuavo rosbag to lerobot-parquet data conversion
# Important!!!
# This branch syncs with lerobot version, with the expected lerobot version being 0.4.1 right now
# Due to the version changes, the data conversion, training as well as inference codes have major revisions! Please use lerobot0.4.1 based data conversion scripts!
# lerobot repository: https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot

rosbag:
  rosbag_dir: /path/to/your/rosbag # rosbag file directory
  num_used: null # Quantities of rosbag used (will randomly choose the selected amount of files). null denotes all rosbags
  lerobot_dir: /your/path/to/your/lerobotdata/  # Lerobot output directory after conversion. The lerobot folder will be created and all converted data will be saved here

dataset:
  #!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  only_arm: true  # Default is true, whether to use only arm data. Setting this to true automatically ignores all lower limb data.
  #!!!!!!!!!!!!Should be true for all tasks in this competition!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  #!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  eef_type: rq2f85 # End-effector type. rq2f85 for simulation. Real-device options being leju_claw (claw, used in this competition) or qiangnao (dexhand)
  which_arm: both  # Which arm joint + image data to use. Available options:left, right, both. Head cam data will be included regardless
  use_depth: true  # Whether to enable depth, according to which cameras to be used from above. The act and dp policies in this branch all have depth support.
  depth_range: [0, 1500]  # Depth image crop area, in mm. Used for normalisation.
 
  task_description: "Pick and Place" # Task description, change if desired

  train_hz: 10  # Training data sampling rate
  main_timeline: head_cam_h # Which cam is your main cam. Default is head_cam_h. Could be changed to wrist_cam_l, wrist_cam_r wrist cam if desired.
  main_timeline_fps: 30 # Main cam frame rate, must be stable. Default is 30fps.
  sample_drop: 10 # Drop 10 frames in the beginning and end of each episode.

  # dex_dof_needed is the dof needed for dex hand. The qiangnao dexhand has 6 dof, with fully closed being [100] * 6, fully open being [0] * 6.
  # 1: When precise operation or multi-finger coordinated operation is not required, it is usually set to 1, which means that only the first joint is needed as the basis for opening and closing.
  #    In this case, [0, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0] is used to represent the open state, and [100] * 6 represents the clenched fist state.
  # 2(Untested): 0,2,3,4,5 dof becomes a single dof.
  # 6(Untested): All 6 dof are available.
  dex_dof_needed: 1   # default=1

  is_binary: false  # Is open and close binary? default=false
  delta_action: false # Whether to use delta for action. default=false. Still under development
  relative_start: false # Whether to use relative start position. default=false


  resize:
    width: 640  # Image width scaling. Please check the original dimensions of the image in ROSBAG first (using tools like FoxGlove)
    # to avoid blurring or stretching distortion caused by enlarging or shrinking.
    height: 480  # Image height scaling. Please check the original dimensions of the image in ROSBAG first (using tools like FoxGlove)
    # to avoid blurring or stretching distortion caused by enlarging or shrinking.
